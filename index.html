      <h1>Bamboo</h1>
      <p>
        Bamboos are a diverse group of evergreen perennial flowering plants in
        the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos
        are the largest members of the grass family. The origin of the word
        "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or
        Portuguese language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.
      </p>
      <p>
        In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are
        usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are
        scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement.
        The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary
        growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large
        bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world,due to a
        unique rhizome-dependent system. Certain species of

        Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world, due to
        a unique rhizome-dependent system. Certain species of bamboo can grow
        910 mm (36 in) within a 24-hour period, at a rate of almost 40 mm (1+1‚ÅÑ2
        in) an hour (equivalent to 1 mm every 90 seconds).[6] This rapid growth
        and tolerance for marginal land, make bamboo a good candidate for
        afforestation, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation
      </p>
      <p>
        Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia, being used for building materials, as a
        food source, and as a versatile raw product. Bamboo, like wood, is a
        natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful
        for structures.[7] Bamboo's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to
        timber, and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or
        hardwood timber.

      <h2>Systematics and Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>
        Bamboos have long been considered the most primitive grasses, mostly
        because of the presence of bracteate, indeterminate inflorescences,
        "pseudospikelets", and flowers with three lodicules, six stamens, and
        three stigmata.[11] Following more recent molecular phylogenetic
        research, many tribes and genera of grasses formerly included in the
        Bambusoideae are now classified in other subfamilies, e.g. the
        Anomochlooideae, the Puelioideae, and the Ehrhartoideae. The subfamily
        in its current sense belongs to the BOP clade of grasses, where it is
        sister to the Pooideae (bluegrasses and relatives).[10]

      <h2>Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        Most bamboo species are native to warm and moist tropical and to warm
        temperate climates.[12] However, many species are found in diverse
        climates, ranging from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions
        and highland cloud forests.
